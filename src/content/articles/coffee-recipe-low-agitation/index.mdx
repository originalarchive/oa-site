## My Low Agitation Brew

### Set-up
1. **1:15 ratio** Between 15-23g of coffee works really well.
2. **88°C** This is my favorite variable. Worth playing between 85 and 90.
3. **Cafec T90 filters** Any upgrade from Hario will give you faster flow and a cleaner cup.
4. **Time doesn't matter** I aim for 2 and a half minutes.
5. **Good water** I buy Sainsbury's own spring water.
6. **Grind size** Commandante 27-29 clicks.
7. **Coffee carafe** Brew in a carafe if you have one. 

### Technique
1. **Bloom twice** 30 seconds each time with 50-70g of water.
2. **Temp drop** Allow it to cool naturally over the 2.5 minutes.
3. **Third pour** Quick circles with low agitation.
4. **Swirl and shake** Swirl to hit a 2:15 - 2:30 total time.

Let it sit for 5-10 minutes. Pour into a beautiful cup—I highly recommend Kinto or Japanese Hasami porcelain.
