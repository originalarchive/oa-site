How do we use the resources around us to read, listen and look for ways to hone our photography skills?

by Ken

It’s funny that trying to find interesting photo blogs, tech sites, online portfolios or generally feed our obsession with photography passively when we can’t take pictures and we don’t want to sit and edit photographs is harder than I realised. 

They say the answer to becoming a better photographer is to take a hell of a lot of photographs, get feedback and explore work by other photographers. If we can’t get our fix practically then how do we use the resources around us to read, listen and look for ways to hone our skills?

- the library (real books!)

- instagram (maybe)

- photo blogs (possibly)

- podcasts (yes, really)

- real life

## Library
Joining a local library near work could get you 30 minutes a few times a week looking at amazing photos in the warmth. Also, who can afford more than a few photo books so access to a near unlimited selection at the library can be amazing.

If you do have the money, take a look at the [Charcoal bookclub](https://charcoalbookclub.com/collections/shop). If you don’t have the money then browse their shop for inspiration and go and borrow the books from your local library!

## Instagram
There are still loads of amazing photographers on instagram (despite instagram being in a bit of a marketing/advertising spiral - probably thanks to facebook). The following are in no specific order:

[@dave.krugman](https://www.instagram.com/dave.krugman/?hl=en) Dave plays with light in a way I have seen few other photographers manage so successfully. If he is not playing with light he is freezing frames to capture flames, rain and mist beautifully. You have to check this guy out.

[@steavesweatpants](https://www.instagram.com/stevesweatpants/?hl=en) Steven John Irby is a great New York street photographer.

[@drawntostreets](https://www.instagram.com/drawntostreets/?hl=en) MIkk Olli plays with black and white contrasts.

[@gboxcreative](https://www.instagram.com/gboxcreative/?hl=en) Superb work and best when playing with solid blocks of colour.

[@jnsilva](https://www.instagram.com/jnsilva/?hl=en) Portraits with a distinctive style.

[@liamwon9](https://www.instagram.com/liamwon9/?hl=en) Bladerunner in photos. So many good shots so long as you love his style.

[@cocu_liu](https://www.instagram.com/cocu_liu/?hl=en) Heavily filtered and stylised but some beautifully composed shots. So many classic San Fran shots re-imagined.

[@chrisconnolly](https://www.instagram.com/chrisconnolly/?hl=en) Truly eclectic collection. A huge number of well composed shots.

[@lindawisdomphotography](https://www.instagram.com/lindawisdomphotography/?hl=en) Stunning photos and technically brilliant. A true street photo star. See Linda’s [website](https://www.lindawisdomphotography.co.uk/) for more shots and details.

Photo blogs / websites

These are hard to keep up with because the web is transient and blogs come and go:

## Podcasts
A category that I had never really thought of for two reasons: I’m not the biggest fan of podcasts and I hadn’t really thought of the visual art of photography being well suited to the auditory medium of podcasting. Well I was wrong, in one instance anyway, thanks to a recommendation from a friend.

A [small voice](https://bensmithphoto.com/asmallvoice/) is a phenomenally good podcast where one famous, less famous or infamous photographer is interviewed by Ben Smith in each episode. So, so good.

## Real life
Clubs, events and galleries are a bit time consuming and can be in sort supply depending on your location. I have never found a great single resource of all clubs so google/facebook is your friend. If you can’t get out and about then join an online photo forum. Having your photos critiqued can be hard but the feedback will be invaluable.

[photography now](http://photography-now.com/exhibition/?type=A) always has a good selection of UK exhibitions.

I’ll come back and add to this page as I find new, cool and interesting places to look at photos. I can guarantee I have missed loads.
