### Tasting Notes
Wine Gums, Cointreau, Stewed fruits

### Ken's Notes
Outrageous aromas - the wine gum / stewed fruits hits you in the face. Taste couldn't live up the nose but it was amazing. Finer grind or coller temps brought bitterness and acidity. Took careful brewing to bring aroma and sweetness at the expense of body and depth
