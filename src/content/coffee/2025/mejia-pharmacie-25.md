### Tasting Notes: 
Juicy and sweet, notes of dried apricot and melon with creamy hazelnut body. 

### Ken's Notes
As this is not the lightest of roasts I have played around with the brew. Low agitation works as always. Batch of 350ml worked amazingly well with 87°C water and 27 clicks. Best I have managed.
