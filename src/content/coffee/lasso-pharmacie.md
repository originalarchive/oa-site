Roasters information: As third-generation coffee farmers, Nestor and his brother Adrian prioritised quality over quantity, making coffee farming a viable and respected way to earn a living. 
Nestor’s passion for coffee, combined with the prospect of a better life, motivated him to transform the family business. Nestor Lasso, a 25-year-old coffee farmer, and his brother took over their family farm five years ago and shifted their focus to producing micro-lots and enhancing post-harvest processes. They are also part of a youth movement in coffee-producing countries, emphasising quality and environmental sustainability. Their hard work and innovation have paid off, as now their coffee is known worldwide and even used for competitions. Nestor acquired much of his theoretical knowledge from a government-subsidised program, learning about the cultivation and processing of specialty coffees. However, he likes to emphasise that true learning happens in the field.  Finca el Diviso is a collaboration project born from two neighbours, both coffee producers, they wanted to cultivate and process even higher scoring coffee. El Diviso Farm belongs to Nestor Lasso and Jhoan Vergara, from Las Flores Farm, it lies in Pitalito at about 1800 m.a.s.l and has the ideal conditions growing specialty coffee beans. This specific coffee went through a double anaerobic fermentation. Straight after picking, the cherries undergo a 20 hours anaerobic fermentation and then again in smaller batches for 16 hours. After depulping and washing, the coffee is submerged in water and leachate from previous harvests for 18 hours, before being mechanically dried.
