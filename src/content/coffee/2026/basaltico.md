Bright lemon cake, caramel and apple aromas. In the cup it's got a delightful combination of rich sweetness and bright acidity - cox's orange pippin apple, satsuma, lemon cake and blackcurrant jam for the acidity, but then dense & rich body and finish that reminds us of muscovado and raisin, with a frangipani element - like fruitcake.
