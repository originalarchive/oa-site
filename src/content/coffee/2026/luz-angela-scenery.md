  The super low agitation two blooms and a single non laminar pour turned out the best cup. Low temp, course grind. 17g:250g  89° 

  One of the best coffee cups I have ever made. Excellent roast.

### Scenery Tasting Notes

Strawberry Jam, Peach Puree, Wild

#### Ken’s notes

First brew. Started with 25c, 89°c. Double brew method 17.8g:250g

Was a fantastic cup - one of the nicest cups I have ever had no funk, nothing silly. Just some jam and fruits on the nose, low bitterness, mid sweetness. 

I know I can develop more of everything. Excellent.

Thirds brew: changed to 28 clicks but kept the temperature and reduced to the even lower agitation two blooms and a single pour method. Flavours amazing, aroma of fruits, zero bitterness, loads of body. Might be a 5/5 brew.
